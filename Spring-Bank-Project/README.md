How to run this application?

There are 2 ways. 

Method 1 : go to any terminal such as cmd in windows and navigate to the folder where BankApplication is
And go to the target folder then type in java
-jar BankApplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar (Default Port)
if you want to customize port use -jar BankApplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=yourportnumber 
yourportnumber example : 8081, 8082 etc.

Method 2 : simply go to the target folder and run BankApplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
This will run the application in background, you won't see it running directly but you can see it in
task manager(Tasks).

Now you can enter in uri followed by your port number which by default is 8080 

The uri for welcome page(get) is http://localhost:8080/api/v1/Bank

The uri for viewing saved accounts(get) is http://localhost:8080/api/v1/Bank/accounts

The uri for adding account(post) is http://localhost:8080/api/v1/Bank/accounts/add

The uri for updating accounts(put) is http://localhost:8080/api/v1/Bank/1/update?email=yourmail&phoneNumber=yourNumber

The uri for adding money(put) is http://localhost:8080/api/v1/Bank/1/add-money?money=5000

The uri for withdrawing money(put) is http://localhost:8080/api/v1/Bank/1/withdraw?money=5000

In all put methods /1/ is merely the user id change the user id for updating different accounts.

An application like postman can be used to test all these apis(They have been thoroughly tested before).
